# Click Driving Behat Features

This is a directory of Behat feature files that are specifically NOT fulfilling Behavior-Driven-Development. These feature files simply drive a series of clicks and browser interactions that confirm that this Drupal 8 site behaves in a way that matches the the Drupal 7 site.

One clear giveaway for these files not being a product of BDD is the overly detailed selectors used in the feature files. Instead of custom definitions that highlight the wants and needs of real people these feature files highlight CSS selectors and the names of form elements.

So why use Behat if the end result is not BDD? Because I don't expect to be able to jump into BDD without learning the nuts and bolts of the tool first.
